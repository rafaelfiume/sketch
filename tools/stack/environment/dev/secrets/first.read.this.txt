Secrets shouldn't be stored in a GitHub repository even if they are for the `dev` environment (i.e. workstation and release pipeline).
This is to decrease the possibility they will eventually leak and pose a breach of security.

`{$PROJECT_DIR}/tools/stack/environment/dev/secrets` directory is necessary to run the Sketch stack locally. 
Please refer to docs/Pipeline.md for more informtion about running the stack in the pipeline.

This is the list of files or evironment vars that are expected in the `secrets` in order to run the stack:
 * `private_key.pem` (see `docs/Authentication.md`)
 * `public_key.pem` (see `docs/Authentication.md`)
 * `DB_PASS` (for instace, in a `sketch.secrets.envs.vars.sh`)

You should use `EcKeyPairPemGenScript` in the `auth0-script` module to generate both the private and publick keys pem files.
Just make sure to move them to this (`secrets`) directory.
