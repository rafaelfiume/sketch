## 1. Project Philosophy

Sketch is built on the principle of conceptual alchemy: **transforming abstract theory into practical engineering solutions**. 

This backend template uses non-obvious ideas, like using Information Theory to [write clearer docs](docs/best-practices/Documentation.md) and [Category Theory](docs/best-practices/Applied-Theory.md#4-mathematical-foundations-category-theory---safe--composable-components) for building predictable and composable software components.

These diverse theories are applied not for their own sake, but to craft solutions to real-world problems. The result is a product that is secure, maintainable and scalable.

> See the section ["Academic" Techniques for Real-World Software Engineering](#4-academic-techniques-for-real-world-software-engineering) for examples of this philosophy in action.


## 2. Start Here

To quickly run Sketch and its dependencies on your local machine, follow the [Onboarding](docs/start-here/Onboarding.md) guide.


## 3. Modules

Sketch is a small monolith carefully divided into **modules** with clear boundaries.

This design provides two key benefits:
 * Rapid development during early and mid stages
 * A smooth migration path to a microservice architecture when scalaling challenges appear.

### 4.1 Postgres as a Lightweight Event Bus

We backend developers understand the immense value an event-driven architecture can bring to a business when implemented effectively.

But what if you don't have access to a Kafka broker or if a Redis Pub/Sub feels overkill, for example?
In such cases, Postgres' `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` can be an excellent alternative.

Here's how it works, using the example of an event-driven system to delete a user's personal data from multiple datasets after their account is deleted:

#### User Account Deleted Event

Define a specific event table (the equivalent of a Kafka topic).

```
CREATE TABLE account_deleted_notifications (
    uuid UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL, -- The ID of the deleted user
    recipient VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- The service responsible for processing
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW() -- When the event was created
);
```

I recommend a single table for each event type to avoid overgeneralisation.

Including `created_at` to the schema adds minimal complexity while offering significant diagnostic value for monitoring stale events. 

#### Microservice Polling

Each service runs a polling job that selects and locks the event for processing:

```
-- Lock the next available event for this consumer
DELETE FROM account_deleted_notifications
WHERE id = (
    SELECT id
    FROM account_deleted_notifications
    WHERE recipient = 'recipient'
    FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
    LIMIT 1
)
RETURNING *;
```

This solution will give us:
 - *Concurrent Processing*: Multiple instances of a service can poll the table for events without locking each other out
 - *Atomicity:* Consuming, processing and removing the event from the table happens as part of the same transaction
 - *Error Handling*: Atomicity ensures that the event is either fully processed or safely retried
 - *No Double Processing*: `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` prevents race conditions and duplicate work
