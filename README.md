## 1. Project Philosophy

Sketch is built on the principle of conceptual alchemy: **transforming abstract theory into practical engineering solutions**. 

This backend template uses non-obvious ideas, like using Information Theory to [write clearer docs](docs/best-practices/Documentation.md) and [Category Theory](docs/best-practices/Applied-Theory.md#4-mathematical-foundations-category-theory---safe--composable-components) for building predictable and composable software components.

These diverse theories are applied not for their own sake, but to craft solutions to real-world problems. The result is a product that is secure, maintainable and scalable.

> See the section ["Academic" Techniques for Real-World Software Engineering](#5-academic-techniques-for-real-world-software-engineering) for examples of this philosophy in action.

## 3. Architecture

Sketch is a relatively small **modular monolith**. It's a single deployable unit, organised into modules, each composed by layers, for [low coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)) and [high cohesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science)).

This design provides two key benefits:
  1. **Fast iteration** during early and mid project stages
  2. A clear **migration path to a microservice architecture** as scaling challenges emerge.

### 3.1 Domain Modules

A domain module represents a distinct and cohesive set of business responsibilities.
Each can be evolved or extracted to a microservice independently later. They:
  * Encapsulate their data and internal implementation
  * Expose functionality through APIs (algebras) with well-defined behaviour.

The following modules compose the current system.

---

#### Identity

Purpose: Identifies users and manages their account lifecycle.

Scope: Handles user registration and authentication.

Future direction: profile management.

([Documentation](auth/README.md))

---

#### Access Control

Purpose: Defines and enforces access-control policies and rules.

Scope: Provides role- and owner-based authorisation mechanisms across modules.

Future direction: Fine-grained permissions to move beyond all-or-nothing access.

([Documentation](shared-access-control/README.md))

---

#### Projects

Scope: Securely handles user documents.

Future direction:
  * Expand to full project lifecycle management, from early business opportunities to live operations
  * Provide actionable business insights, such development opportunities and ROI.

### 3.2 Application Layers

Layers provide a clear separation of concerns, ensuring the system remains adaptable in a fast-evolving environment.


| Layer                       | Responsibility             | Components             | Dependencies             |  Do Not Allow |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Inbound Adapters            | Exposes functionalities via external interfaces (REST, gRPC, etc).<br>Handles input validation, serialisation/deserialisation.<br>Convert external calls into a format the application layer understands, thus isolating the core domain | Http Routes. E.g., [UserRoutes](/auth/src/main/scala/org/fiume/sketch/auth/http/UsersRoutes.scala) | Application / Domain (entities) | ðŸš« Exposed domain entities to external world (use DTOs)<br> ðŸš« Business-logic <br> ðŸš« DAOs or external APIs used directly |
| Application                 | Implements use-cases by orchestrating domain components and invoking external modules through ports.<br>Defines transaction boundaries | E.g. [UsersManager](/auth/src/main/scala/org/fiume/sketch/auth/accounts/UsersManager.scala) | Domain (entities, ports) | ðŸš« Bypass business rules <br> ðŸš« Direct infrastructure access (e.g. low-level transaction code) |
| Domain                      | The core value of the system. Expresses the business model, rules, and ports (contracts) for required external capabilities | * *Entities*, e.g. [User](/shared-auth/src/main/scala/org/fiume/sketch/shared/auth/User.scala)<br>* *Ports*, e.g. [UsersStore](/shared-auth/src/main/scala/org/fiume/sketch/shared/auth/algebras/UsersStore.scala) | None | ðŸš« Dependencies on any other layer |
| Infrastructure (Outbound Adapters) | Implements ports, persisting the domain state, or calling external APIs | *DAO*, e.g. [PostgresUsersStore](/storage/src/main/scala/org/fiume/sketch/storage/auth/postgres/PostgresUsersStore.scala) | Domain (ports; entities as inputs/outputs) | ðŸš« Business rules ðŸš« Leaking infrastructure details <br> |

> **Note**: We favour pragmatism over purism. The Application Layer exposes Domain Entities as input and output to Inbound Adapters to avoid unnecessary DTOs, reducing indirection without sacrificing maintainability. 

> This simplifies the code and preserves strong encapsulation. The **key boundary** remains between domain and external systems: entities must be converted to DTOs within Adapters, shielding the domain from the outside world.

**Compile-time dependencies:**

```
[ Inbound Adapters ] -> [ Application ] -> [ Domain ] <- [ Infrastructure ]

```


## 4. DevOps Practices

This project uses DevOps practices to automate releases and operational tasks, improve collaboration and build a cloud-ready, scalable application.

The goal is to **increase release cadence with confidence** through [shift-left testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing) and reliable operations.

### 4.1 Continuous Integration

The [CI pipeline](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/rafaelfiume/sketch) automatically builds, tests, versions and [publishes](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/rafaelfiume/sketch) an image of the newest application version whenever changes are committed.
This ensures repeatable and frequent releases, preventing the pain of massive and infrequent release cycles. 

> **Note:** Continuous Delivery (CD) will expand this process to automatically deploy new versions to production.

See [Releases documentation](docs/devops/Releases.md).

### 4.2 The 12-Factor Principles

Applying the 12-Factors helps ensure the application is **portable**, **cloud-native** and **scalable**. 

Current focus includes [Admin Processes](/docs/devops/Admin.md),
with future guides planned for other principles, such as processes and logs.

### 4.3 Scripting Guidelines

Scripts **automate repetitive tasks** and work as **executable documentation**, with precise instructions to perform tasks, from starting the application stack to automating the release pipeline.

See the [Scripting Guidelines](docs/devops/Scripting.md) for tips on writing effective and maintainable scripts.

### 4.4 Future Directions

The plan is to expand DevOps practices in these areas:
  * **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Declarative infrastructure provisioning with Terraform
  * **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Automatic release to production after successful CI build
  * **Monitoring & Observability**: Metrics, logs and tracing with Prometheus, Grafana and Jaeger
  * **Security Practices**: Integrated security scanning and solid secrets management.

```
[ CI ] -> [IaC] -> [ CD ] -> [ Observability ] -> [ Security Practices ]
```

### 5.1 Postgres as a Lightweight Event Bus

We backend developers understand the immense value an event-driven architecture can bring to a business when implemented effectively.

But what if you don't have access to a Kafka broker or if a Redis Pub/Sub feels overkill, for example?
In such cases, Postgres' `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` can be an excellent alternative.

Here's how it works, using the example of an event-driven system to delete a user's personal data from multiple datasets after their account is deleted:

#### User Account Deleted Event

Define a specific event table (the equivalent of a Kafka topic).

```
CREATE TABLE account_deleted_notifications (
    uuid UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL, -- The ID of the deleted user
    recipient VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- The service responsible for processing
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW() -- When the event was created
);
```

I recommend a single table for each event type to avoid overgeneralisation.

Including `created_at` to the schema adds minimal complexity while offering significant diagnostic value for monitoring stale events. 

#### Microservice Polling

Each service runs a polling job that selects and locks the event for processing:

```
-- Lock the next available event for this consumer
DELETE FROM account_deleted_notifications
WHERE id = (
    SELECT id
    FROM account_deleted_notifications
    WHERE recipient = 'recipient'
    FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
    LIMIT 1
)
RETURNING *;
```

This solution will give us:
 - *Concurrent Processing*: Multiple instances of a service can poll the table for events without locking each other out
 - *Atomicity:* Consuming, Processing and removing the event from the table happens as part of the same transaction
 - *Error Handling*: Atomicity ensures that the event is either fully processed or safely retried
 - *No Double Processing*: `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` prevents race conditions and duplicate work
