# Domain

## Documents

Documents are a core domain concept as many workflows are supported by or require them.
They come in many forms: images, texts, ids, and are considered extremelly sensitive.

### Metadata

Document metadata are anything that not the content of the document itself, for instance `name` and `description`.
Future metadata might include `owner`, `workflow`, `fileSize`, `fileType`, `fileHash`, `fileLocation`, `fileFormat`, `fileEncoding`, `fileCompression`, etc.

###Â Data Privacy

If documents are sensitive, there must be a reason for storing it. The reason should be a workflow that requires it.
There should be regular clean ups once a document is no longer needed.
A document 'no longer neeed' will be specific to the business.
