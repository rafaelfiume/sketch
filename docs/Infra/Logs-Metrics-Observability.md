# Logs - Metrics - Observability (Draft)

## A Modern Observability Stack

In a modern observability setup, we might combine several tools for best results:

    Metrics: Prometheus for collecting metrics.
    Logs: Loki for efficient log storage, or Elasticsearch if more complex querying is needed.
    Tracing: OpenTelemetry or Jaeger to track requests across microservices.
    Visualization: Grafana for visualizing metrics and logs together, and Kibana if Elasticsearch is used.

To be implemented....
