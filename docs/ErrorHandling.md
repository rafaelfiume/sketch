# Error Handling (Draft)

'Error' means any kind of error, being its source customers (e.g. input validation) or system errors.

`ErrorInfo` should:
 - Be the response payload provided by endpoints in case of errors
 - Be tracked - see 'Tracking Errors' session below
 - Have a severity assigned to it.

 Severety levels are:
 - Info:
 - Warning:
 - Critical: Prevents the system for functioning and are not recoverable (e.g system or resource is down).

`ErrorCode`:
- Should be used to facilitate troubleshooting
- Should not be exposed to end customers
- Should conform to simple and clear semantic rules
- Must not leak details that could compromise system integrity

### We have a message for you
